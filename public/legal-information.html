                    Ali Kurnaz built the DaysToGo app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by Ali Kurnaz at no
                    cost and is intended for use as is. <br><br>
                    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
                    of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. <br><br>
                    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
                    Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
                    Policy. <br><br>
                    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>
                    For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain
                    personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device
                    and is not collected by me in any way. <br><br>

                <h2>Log Data</h2>
                <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect
                    data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                    include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating
                    system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your
                    use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
                    internal memory. <br><br>
                    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
                    libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
                    to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                    choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

                <ul class="normal-list">
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal
                    Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
                    obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the
                    internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
                <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
                    directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no
                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
                </p>
                <h2>Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
                <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child
                    under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If
                    you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                    information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.</p>
                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                    this page. <br><br>
                    This policy is effective as of 2023-01-07</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Terms & <span>Conditions</span></h1>
                <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you &ndash; you should make
                    sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You&#39;re not allowed to copy or
                    modify
                    the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&#39;re not allowed to attempt to
                    extract
                    the source code of the app, and you also shouldn&#39;t try to translate the app into other languages
                    or
                    make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and
                    other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Ali Kurnaz. <br><br>
                    Ali Kurnaz is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
                    reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
                    and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                    clear to you exactly what you&#39;re paying for. <br><br>
                    The DaysToGo app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my
                    Service. It&#39;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
                    restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
                    your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone&#39;s security
                    features and it could mean that the DaysToGo app won&#39;t work properly or at all. <br><br>
                    The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. <br><br>

                <p>
                    You should be aware that there are certain things that Ali Kurnaz will not take responsibility for.
                    Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
                    connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Ali Kurnaz cannot take
                    responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don&#39;t have access to Wi-Fi,
                    and
                    you don&#39;t have any of your data allowance left. <br><br>
                    If you&#39;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                    app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you&#39;re accepting responsibility for any
                    such
                    charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                    region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                    which you&#39;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                    from
                    the bill payer for using the app. <br><br>
                    Along the same lines, Ali Kurnaz cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
                    You need to make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of battery and you
                    can&#39;t turn
                    it on to avail the Service, Ali Kurnaz cannot accept responsibility. <br><br>
                    With respect to Ali Kurnaz&#39;s responsibility for your use of the app, when you&#39;re using the
                    app, it&#39;s
                    important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
                    times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to
                    you. Ali Kurnaz accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                    relying wholly on this functionality of the app. <br><br>
                    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS
                    &ndash; the
                    requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
                    availability of the app to) may change, and you&#39;ll need to download the updates if you want to
                    keep
                    using the app. Ali Kurnaz does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
                    to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
                    you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
                    stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
                    you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                    device. <br><br>
